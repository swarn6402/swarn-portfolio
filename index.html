            >Hey there! I'm Swarnjeet, a full-stack developer who loves turning
            complex problems into elegant solutions. Currently pursuing my
            Bachelor's in Engineering, I blend my hardware knowledge with my
            passion for web development to create unique digital
            experiences.</strong
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          During my time at StarX91 Technologies, I had the opportunity to dive
          deep into modern web development, where I significantly improved
          website performance and implemented new features using React and
          Node.js. What drives me is not just writing code, but creating
          solutions that make a real difference in user experience and
          performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm particularly proud of my work on autonomous systems, especially my
          racing drone project where I combined computer vision with real-time
          processing. It's this intersection of hardware and software that
          really gets me excited -- there's something magical about seeing code
          transform into physical action!
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies or
          contributing to the tech community. I've had the chance to organize
          our college tech fest and contribute to local NGOs, experiences that
          have taught me the value of both leadership and teamwork.
        </p>

        <p>
          My technical toolbox includes React, Node.js, TypeScript, and Python,
          along with experience in AWS, Docker, and MongoDB. But what really
          sets me apart is my ability to see the bigger picture -- whether it's
          optimizing website performance, implementing efficient algorithms, or
          designing intuitive user interfaces.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe in continuous learning and pushing boundaries. From winning
          entrepreneurship competitions to exploring drone technology, I'm
          always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow. If you're
          interested in creating innovative solutions or just want to chat about
          technology, I'd love to connect!
        </p>

        <p>Let's build something amazing together! ðŸš€</p>

        <p>Best Regards,<br />SNT</p>
